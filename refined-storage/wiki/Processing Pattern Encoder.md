A Processing Pattern Encoder is used to create [[Pattern|patterns]] meant for machine automation.

It takes up to 9 inputs and 9 outputs, so the storage network knows what to take and what to expect.

This block can't be connected to a storage network.

## Recipe transferring
The Processing Pattern Encoder integrates with [JEI (Just Enough Items)](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jei) so the player can use recipe transferring.

When using this, Refined Storage will use the inputs and outputs that the [JEI](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jei) recipe has.
