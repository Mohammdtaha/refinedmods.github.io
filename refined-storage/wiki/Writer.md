A Writer has the ability to manage Reader / [[Writer]] channels on a network.

The Writer is a block that exposes items, fluids, energy and / or a redstone signal from the bound channel. The data that is received is sent from the [[Reader]].

The Writer doesn't auto-push any of the supported types (with an exception to redstone signals). You have to extract it manually.

## Supported types
- Items
- Fluids
- Energy
- Redstone
